## Welcome to my development site on GitHub

I am an old dog learning new tricks. This is my first time playing around in GitHub so I'm starting out with some basics. I've been a web developer in the digital marketing industry for close to 15 years now. Stagnancy is the enemy. I try to learn new things as often as I can.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/krisalis903/krisalis903.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
